Main Features:
  - task 1: I enabled the firebase authentication within my firebase
  - task 2: Created a folder to hold the authentication components 
    - folder: auth/authentication
      - authentication.component.html
      - authentication.component.ts
      - authentication.component.css
  - task 3: Created a service component to add the methods for signUp
  - task 4: added the service component to the html and ts component to send a 
            message to the websites console that would say it was clicked. The data
            was then added to my firebase
Bonus Features:
  - Created a authResponse.ts to the authentication folder to allow a new method
    to be created for logging in. 
  - Created the login method that takes in an email and password and takes in a secure
    token to be saved so that it is not public. 
  - Created if statements within the authentication component to return a response that
    login or sign up was clicked and would save that to the firebase
