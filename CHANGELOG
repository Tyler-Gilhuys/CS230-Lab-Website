Main Features:
  - task 1: Moved my mock-information-list.ts file information to my backend, added all three attributes I had for each
    - img
    - header
    - find
    - nearest
    - address
    - state
    - hours
    - phone 
  - task 2: Created a service component, information.service.ts, to connect my backend information list to the website
    - contains:
      - baseURL
      - informationEndPoint
      - private HttpClient
      - getInformation Method
  - task 3: After creating the service component for the information mock list, i updated the information within my home-layout.component.ts file
            this contains my onInit, a private within the constructor calling InformationService, and has the ngOnInit() class
Bonus Features:
  - Moved two other mock-list to my backend:
    - Menu-layout mock list, mock_menu_layout.component.ts
      - named menu-layout within firebase
      - have a service component, menu-layout.service.ts that has all necessary information to output to the website 
        - this include the stuff within the html file, and originally ts file created with the original component
    - Menu mock list, mock_menu_layout.component.ts
      - NOTE: this is different from the one above as they are two different components on two different pages of the website
      - named menu within firebase
      - have a service component, menu.service.ts, that has all necessary information to output to the website 
        - this include the stuff within the html file, and originally ts file created with the original component
        
Side Note: 
  Screenshots are of each component i had modified with my backend.
