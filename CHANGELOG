Main Features:
  - task 1: Created the mandatory 6 new components within the Delivery and Menu layouts 
    - Created cards, search bars, and buttons through each of the two layouts 
    - components are throughout the 
      menupage.component.html
      menuheader.component.html
      delivery-layout.component.html
      mobileapp.component.html
       
  - task 2: Created mock list and model for the ngFor loop within the menu layout page
    - note: I am struggling with getting the format correctly but i have it working for each of the cards component aspects
    - ngFor Loop is set within the menu-layout.component.html, which comes from the menupage.component.html
      - Attributes added
        - three strings (img/header/button)
        - 9 instances of the loop
  - task 3: All components are already in a container within each html file, with the exception of the ngFor loop within the menu-layout.component.html. 
            This component has "container d-flex" to line up vertically within a row
      
Bonus Features:
  - Added a two components to the location-layout.component.html
    two cards:
      - one card has a statement within a search bar, button, and filter.
      - other card is supposed to be a list from a map (cannot understand how to insert that)
        - this components has the list of 3 locations within the morgantown area
  - On the main page or (home-layout.component.html) added another card component that also connects with the menu page
  - Added CSS and best to my ability formatting everything to my possible extent
